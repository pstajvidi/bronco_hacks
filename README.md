# Local Restaurant Recommender 
We created Easy Eats in order to help food lovers and community members not have to struggle to find and support small, locally-owned restaurants. Our web app connects people with hidden gems in their area, empowering communities to uplift independent businesses with every meal.

# Set Up 
Our development environment consists of three active branches (excluding main), each dedicated to a core component of the application:

**Frontend:** Built with React, handling UI/UX design and client-side navigation. The userAuthentication is also done here, but can be alterd to allow for API calls instead. 

**Backend (api branch):** Powered by Spring Boot, serving as a REST API for restaurant data management. We will be using this to populate restaurants data for users to pick.
